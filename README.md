## About the project
Knowledge Crusher is a speed typing game which will help the user increase their typing speed through fun competition.

On entering the site, the user must choose a username and the difficulty level they would like to play at. During the game, words must be typed correctly in order to advance the player's sprite toward the finish line. Incorrect answers will result in the sprite moving toward the "wall of doom". No response will also slowly move the player's sprite toward the "wall of doom", which will end the game if touched. 

Knowledge Crusher utilizes local storage for the high score table, so please use the same computer if you would like to compete with your friends.
