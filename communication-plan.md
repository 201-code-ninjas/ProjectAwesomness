# Group Communication Plan
----------

#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
We have agreed to use the Amazon Chime group messaging app to communicate outside of class hours & on evenings and weekends.

We're following the general schedule of 9am-9pm for expected responses. Outside of these hours, we shouldn't expect a fast response.

#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
We have decided to elect a project manager for final decisions and group management. We are all responsible for being aware of whether we are talking more in comparison to the rest of our teammates, and the project manager can step in if needed to direct converstion.

####How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
We strive to create and maintain an environment where no one is repremanded for sharing ideas or thoughts. To achieve this, we're all taking an owners mindset of the group and will gently guide/challenge each other to provide constructive feedback during discussions. 
Part of our daily group discussion should include honest feedback on whether we feel the group dynamic is functioning well. We should reflect on this feedback and adjust as needed.
