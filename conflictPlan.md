#----------------------Conflict Plan--------------------------
When disagreements occuring during the production of projectAwesomeness the following procedures will be followed in order to facilitate effective discourse and reach a commonly agreed upon solution in a timely manner.

An opportunity will be provided for each side to present their respective side to the groupe as a whole.  This discourse will last 5-10 minutes at which time, the group as a whole will decide, through popular vote, which course of action to persue.  Once the decision has been made there will no longer be further debat, but the group will move forward adopting the agreed upon decision.

In the event that the group is split evenly between two possible courses of action, it will be left to the identified team leader to have the final decision.
